# Aframe
Exploring the intersection between music information and AI.

Aframe applies Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to allow users to gain knowledge through interaction with GPT-3.5. The LLM references information found in the album reviews written on Pitchfork.com between Jan 5, 1999 and Jan 8, 2017.

The dataset is compreised of 18,393 Pitchfork.com reviews and I've used an OpenAI embedding model to create a vector database living on Pinecone. 

There's much more to share. I'll flesh out this readme soon enough.
